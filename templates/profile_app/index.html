            <p>My name is Anthony.</p>
            <p>I'm a passionate software developer who was born in Lima-Peru.</p>
            <p>Got my bachelors in Mechanical Engineering and MBA from Purdue University. Some people call us Boiler Makers. Why? You ask... No idea, I'm foreign...</p>
            <p>I admire Steve Jobs, Elon Musk, Mozart, the guy from 'Deez nutz' and my lovely mother (she kinda annoying tho)</p>
            <p>My dream is to become the next big thing in software development, music and acting.</p>
            <p>My goal is to make a difference and be recorded in history books.</p>

        <h2>Why should you hire me,</h2>
        <h2>Work with me, or</h2>
        <h2>Be my friend?</h2>
        <p>Because I will do my very best to get you the best working web or software application.</p>
        <p>Because I'm motivated to succeed and make a positive change in this world. </p>
        <p>Because I will be as loyal as a wolf (a cool Gray wolf). </p>
        <p>Because I will always be myself. </p>
        <h2>Not sure yet?</h2>
        <p>Keep Scrolling... Everything will be fine! (As I whisper in your ear)</p>
